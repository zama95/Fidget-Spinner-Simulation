# Fidget Spinner Game (Python & Pygame)

This project is a simple interactive fidget spinner game, built using Python and Pygame. It replicates the mechanics of a real fidget spinner, allowing users to spin, change colors, and control the speed. This is a mini project I created in my first year during the first semester for fun and learning Python.
